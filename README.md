# COMP290 Trie Spell Checker

This project use's a C++ implementation of a **Trie** data structure to contain the entire English language. A search algorithm is used
to implement a spell checker, allowing the user to check their spelling of words and to also add new words to the Trie.

This approach uses several optimizations to handle creation, insertion and search. I've also explored other possible implementations
and weighed up their pros and cons. 

### Usage

To run the software, just run SpellChecker.exe to access the program from the command line.
